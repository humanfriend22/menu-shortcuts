# Menu Shortcuts
A tiny macOS menu bar app containing some shortcuts I would like in my menu bar

### Shortcuts
- `reset ssh`: Clears your known_hosts file for ssh
- `ip`: Copies your IP address to your clipboard
- `spotify`: Quits and relaunches Spotify

### Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Open in xcode
3. (In xcode menu bar) -> Product -> Build
4. (In xcode menu bar) -> Product -> Show Build Folder in Finder
5. (In the Finder window that opened) -> Products -> (Debug or Release) -> the `.app`
6. Drag and drop the app to your Applications folder
7. Open spotlight (`cmd+space`) and run `Menu Shortcuts`
8. You should now see a new icon in your menu bar
